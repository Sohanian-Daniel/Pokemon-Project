# Pokemon-Project

Made for an Object Oriented Programming course in early 2022.

Implements various Design Patterns : Singleton, Factory, Builder, Facade and Command.

Features:
- Pokemons with HP, Attack, Special Attack, Defense and Special Defense stats
- Abilities that deal damage, stun enemies, grant dodges and have cooldowns.
- Pokemons can "level up" increasing all their stats by +1.
- Items that can be equipped on Pokemons giving them stat bonuses.
- Adventures comprising of 3 Arena Battles against either a "Neutral" pokemon or against "other players"
- A very basic Trainer AI that simply chooses a random move.

TODO:
- Use a markdown language (like XML) in order to store and easily modify pokemons without editing the code.
- Implement actual networking instead of simulating the server and its players by using threads.
- Allow the user to play the game and not just simulate its choices.
